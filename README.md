Zend Framework Website, v2.0
============================

This is the next incarnation of the Zend Framework website, written using ZF2.

Installation
------------

First step is grabbing dependencies. Run the following:

    php composer.phar install

At that point, you can test with the built-in webserver of PHP 5.4:

    cd public
    php -S localhost:8080

Alternately, configure a virtual host in the webserver of your choice.
