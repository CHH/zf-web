      <title>Zend Framework 2.0.0rc6 Released!</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
of Zend Framework 2.0.0rc6! Packages and installation instructions are
available at:

<p>
We've been releasing release candidates weekly since mid-July. 
At this time, RC6 is slated to be the last release candidate before shipping a 
stable version. 
</p>

<p>
RC6 has continued the cycle of decreasing numbers of pull requests, lending 
weight to the idea that we are hitting a stable API. Around 30 patches
were handled -- though not all were merged -- ranging from small consistency 
fixes to solutions for often-reported issues. Additionally, around 20 
documentation patches were handled, providing a steady stream of updates
for the user guide.
</p>

<p>
The full changelog is as follows:
</p>

<pre>
- Zend\Config
  - The INI adapter now allows bracket notation for appending values to an array
    within INI definitions.
- Zend\Db
  - ResultInterface adds isBuffered() method for checking if the resultset is
    buffered or not. Allows for more fine grained control of result set
    buffering, including using the database engine's native buffering.
  - Insertions with multi-part keys now work properly.
  - Expression objects may now be passed to the order() method of a Select
    object.
- Zend\Form
  - You can now omit error messages on elements when rendering via formRow(), by
    passing a boolean false as the third argument of the helper.
  - You can now use concrete hydrator instances with the factory.
  - You may now set the CSRF validator class and/or options to use on the Csrf
    element
  - The Select, Radio, and MultiCheckbox elements and view helpers were
    refactored to move value options into properties, instead of attributes.
    This makes them more consistent with other elements, and simplifies the
    interfaces.
  - Forms now lazy-load an input filter if none has been specified; this should
    simplify usage for many, and remove the "no input filter attached"
    exception.
  - All form helpers for buttons (button, submit, reset) now allow translation.
  - The formRow() view helper now allows you to set the CSS class used to
    designate an input with errors.
- Zend\Http
  - Some browser/web server combingations set SERVER_NAME to the IPv6 address,
    and enclose it in brackets. The PhpEnvironment\Request object now correctly
    detects such situations.
  - The Socket client will only fallback to SSLv3 if the ssltransport
    configuration key is not set (instead of also allowing SSLv2).
- Zend\I18n\Translator
  - Loader\LoaderInterface was splitted into Loader\FileLoaderInterface and
    Loader\RemoteLoaderInterface. The latter one will be used in ZF 2.1 for
    a database loader.
  - Translator::addTranslationPattern() and the option "translation_patterns"
    were renamed to Translator::addTranslationFilePattern and
    "translation_file_patterns".
  - A new method Translator::addRemoteTranslations() was added.
- Zend\Mvc
  - Application no longer defines the "application" identifier for its composed
    EventManager instance. If you had listeners listening on that context,
    update them to use "Zend\Mvc\Application". See this thread for more details:

      http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/Change-to-Zend-Mvc-Application-s-event-identifiers-tp4656517.html

  - The redirect plugin's toRoute() method signature is now synced with that of
    the url plugin's fromRoute() method.
  - The PRG plugin now allows passing no arguments; if you do so, the currently
    matched route will be used for the redirect.
- Zend\Paginator
  - Removes the factory() and related methods. This was done to be more
    consistent with other components, and also because the utility was not
    terribly useful; in most cases, developers needed to configure the adapter
    up-front anyways.
- Zend\Stdlib
  - ClassMethods Hydrator now supports boolean getters prefixed with "is".
- Zend\Validator
  - DB validators no longer mix positional and named parameters.

      <title>Zend Framework 2.0.0beta5 Released!</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
of Zend Framework 2.0.0beta5. Packages and installation instructions are
available at:

<p>
This is the fifth and last in a series of planned beta releases. The beta 
release cycle has followed the "gmail" style of betas, whereby new features 
have been added in each new release, and backwards compatibility (BC) has not 
been guaranteed. The desire has been for developers to adopt and work with new 
components as they are shipped, and provide feedback so we can polish the 
distribution.
</p>

<p>
Our plan at this time is to do some cleanup of the repository, fix some 
outstanding issues and features, migrate documentation to a new repository and 
format, and then begin the release candidate process. At this time, we 
anticipate few if any BC breaks between now and the first release candidate (RC).
Applications built today on beta5 will operate in the way we expect them to for 
the stable release.
</p>

<p>
Beta5 had a rigorous and busy schedule. We tackled a number of consistency
issues, and solidified the security the framework offers via several fixes and 
the new Escaper component. We processed over 400 pull requests again, in a 
shorter timeframe than we had for beta4; the community really pulled together
to get this release out the door.
</p>

<p>
    There are three primary new features for the release:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li><code>Zend\Escaper</code>, which provides an OWASP-compliant solution 
        for context-specific escaping mechanisms targetting HTML, HTML attributes, 
        URLs, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
    <li><code>Zend\I18n</code>, which leverages <acronym title="PHP Hypertext 
        Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>'s <code>ext/intl</code> extension to 
        provide localization, and also provides a new translation component.</li>
    <li><code>Zend\Form</code> now has new annotation support, allowing you
        to define annotations in your domain entities that can then be used
        to build a form and its related input filter and hydrator. Annotation
        support now has a dependency on <a 
        href="http://doctrine-project.org">Doctrine\Common</a>'s annotation 
        library, for our default annotation syntax parser.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    2.0.0beta5 had many more changes, as you can see from the release changelog:
</p>

<pre>
 - Escaper component (Padraic Brady)
    - Provides context-specific escaping mechanisms for HTML content,
      HTML attributes, URLs, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - BC BREAK: The escape() view helper was removed, and replaced with
      escapeHtml(), escapeHtmlAttr(), escapeJs(), escapeCss(), and
      escapeUrl() implementations.
 - New I18n component (Ben Scholzen, Chris Martin, Dennis Portnov,
   Matthew Weier O'Phinney)
    - New component leveraging PHP's ext/intl extension to provide
      internationalization (i18n) and localization (L10n) features and
      capabilities to applications.
    - LEVERAGES:
        - DateTime, DateTimezone, IntlDateFormatter
        - Locale
        - NumberFormatter
    - BC BREAK: REMOVES the following components:
        - Zend\Currency
        - Zend\Date
        - Zend\Locale
        - Zend\Measure
        - Zend\Translator
        - All filters, validators, and view helpers that relied on the
          above.
    - PROVIDES:
        - Zend\I18n\Translator, including support for gettext and
          PHP-array-based translations (more are planned).
        - Zend\I18n\Filter, containing localized filtering capabilites
          for Alnum (alphanumeric), Alpha (alphabetic), and NumberFormat
          (numerical strings).
        - Zend\I18n\Validator, containing localized validation
          capabilities for Alnum (alphanumeric), Alpha (alphabetic),
          Iban (international bank account number standard), Int
          (integer), and PostCode (localized postal codes).
        - Zend\I18n\View, containing localized view helpers for
          CurrencyFormat, DateFormat, NumberFormat, Translate, and
          TranslatePlural.
 - Db layer additions (Ralph Schindler, Rob Allen, Guillaume Metayer,
   Sascha Howe, Chris Testroet, Evan Coury, Ben Youngblood)
    - Metadata support
    - Postgresql adapter/driver
    - New HydratingResultSet, allowing the ability to specify a custom
      hydrator (from Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator) for hydrating row objects.
    - Many bugfixes and stabilizations
 - Form additions (Matthew Weier O'Phinney, Michaël Gallego, Yanick Rochon)
    - Annotations support: Ability to use annotations with a domain
      object in order to define a form, fieldsets, elements, inputs and
      input filters, and more.
    - Hydration of fieldsets; fieldsets may compose their own hydrators
      if desired.
    - Collection support; allows multiple instances of the same
      fieldset. As an example, you might have an interface that
      allows adding a set of form elements via an XHR call; on the
      backend, these would be defined as a collection, allowing
      arbitrary numbers of these fieldsets to be submitted.
    - New view helpers covering most HTML5-specific element types, most
      XHTML-specific element types. Additionally, a number of the
      HTML5-specific element types now have Element implementations to
      create turn-key solutions that include validation and filtering.
    - BC BREAK: Options support. Many attributes were being used not as
      HTML attributes but to define behavior. The ElementInterface now
      has an accessor and mutator for options. Examples of options
      include labels for non-radio/checkbox/select elements, the CAPTCHA
      adapter for CAPTCHA elements, CSRF tokens, etc. If you were
      defining labels in your forms, please move the label and label
      attributes definitions from the "attributes" to the "options" of
      the element, fieldset, or form.
    - BC BREAK: new interface, ElementPrepareAwareInterface, defining
      the method "prepareElement(Form $form)". The FieldsetInterface,
      and, by extension, FormInterface, extend this new interface. It is
      used to allow preparing elements prior to creating a
      representation.
 - MVC additions (Kyle Spraggs, Evan Coury, Matthew Weier O'Phinney)
    - New "Params" controller plugin. Allows retrieving query, post,
      cookie, header, and route parameters. Usage is
      $this->params()->fromQuery($name, $default).
    - New listener, Zend\Mvc\ModuleRouteListener. When enabled, if a
      route match contains a "\__NAMESPACE__" key, that namespace value
      will be prepended to the value of the "controller" key. This
      should typically be used in the root route for a given module, to
      ensure controller names do not clash.
    - Bootstrap simplification. A new "init()" method was created that
      accepts the path to a configuration file, and then creates and
      bootstraps the application; this eliminates all common boilerplate
      for the bootstrap scripts.
 - Hydrator changes (Adam Lundrigan)
    - BC BREAK: the ClassMethods hydrator now assumes by default that
      it should convert between underscore_separated names and
      camelCase.
 - BC BREAK: Doctrine Annotations Parser (Matthew Weier O'Phinney, Marco
   Pivetta, Guilherme Blanco)
    - Zend\Code\Annotation now has a dependency on Doctrine\Common for
      its annotation parser.
    - Annotations now conform to Doctrine's standards by default, but
      the AnnotationManager in ZF2 allows attaching alternate parsers
      for specific annotation types.
 - BC BREAK: Removal of Plugin Broker usage (Matthew Weier O'Phinney,
   Evan Coury)
    - All uses of the Plugin Broker / Plugin Class Locator combination
      were removed. A new class, Zend\ServiceManager\AbstractPluginManager, 
      was created and used to replace all previous usages of the plugin
      broker. This provides more flexibility in creation of plugins, as
      well as reduces the number of APIs developers need to learn.
    - Configuration of plugin managers is now done at the top-level. All
      plugin manager configuration follows the format utilized by
      Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceConfiguration, and
      Zend\ModuleManager\Listener\ServiceListener has been updated to
      allow informing it of plugin manager instances it should manage,
      as well as the configuration key to utilize.
 - BC BREAK: Coding Standards (Maks3w, Sascha Prolic, Rob Allen)
    - Renamed most abstract classes to prefix them with the term
      "Abstract". In particular, ActionController and RestfulController
      are now AbstractActionController and AbstractRestfulController.
    - Renamed getters in HTTP, EventManager, and Mail components. These
      components were using accessors such as "events()", "query()",
      "headers()", etc. All such accessors were renamed to prepend
      "get", and, in the case of "events()", renamed to indicate the
      actual object retrieved ("getEventManager()"). 
 - SECURITY FIX: XmlRpc (Matthew Weier O'Phinney)
    - A security issue arising from XML eXternal Entity (XXE) injection
      was patched; see http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2012-01

<p>
This is the fourth in a series of planned beta releases. The beta release
cycle is following the "gmail" style of betas, whereby new features will
be added in each new release, and BC will not be guaranteed; beta
releases will happen <em>approximately</em> every six weeks. The desire is for
developers to adopt and work with new components as they are shipped, and
provide feedback so we can polish the distribution.
</p>

<p>
Our plan at this time is to have one last beta towards the end of June 2012, 
and then begin the release candidate process. At this time, the MVC is looking
and operating in the way we expect it to for the stable release.
</p>

<p>
Beta4 was tremendously busy; as I compiled the release notes and looked through
the pull requests, I discovered we'd handled more than double the number of 
pull requests, and did similarly in terms of delivering new features and rewrites.
The community did a tremendous amount of work polishing the framework and making
it better.
</p>

<p>
From the release changelog:
</p>

<pre>
 - Config component (Enrico Zimuel)

    - Zend\Db\TableGateway: reorganized AbstractTableGateway and TableGateway,
      removed other extensions in favor of "Features"
    - Zend\Db\TableGateway: created a "Features" API in TableGatway to promote
      horizontal extension of TableGatway
 - Di (Ralph Schindler, Marco Pivetta)
    - Added method injectDependencies($instance), to allow injecting an object
      after an instance is already available (used in the ServiceManager)
    - Various fixes based on issue reports
 - Dojo
    - REMOVED. Support was for out-dated versions of Dojo, and with the new Form
      rewrite, it needs to be completely rewritten. This is targetted for post
      2.0.0 at this time.
 - EventManager (Matthew Weier O'Phinney)
    - New SharedEventManager, a non-static version of the original
      StaticEventManager
    - StaticEventManager now extends SharedEventManager and implements a
      singleton pattern
    - New ServiceManager creates a shared instance of SharedEventManager and
      injects it in a non-shared EventManager instance per service; static usage
      is discouraged at this time.
    - attachAggregate() now accepts an optional $priority, which, when present,
      will be passed to the ListenerAggregate, allowing specifying a priority
      during attachment of its events.
    - EventManager now can handle arrays of events as well as wildcard events
    - SharedEventManager now can handle arrays of contexts, wildcard contexts,
      and arrays/wildcard events.
 - Form (Matthew Weier O'Phinney, Kyle Spraggs, Guilherme Blanco)
    - Complete rewrite
    - Elements compose a name and attributes
    - Fieldsets compose a name, attributes, and elements and fieldsets
    - Forms compose a name, attributes, elements, fieldsets, an InputFilter, and
      optionally a Hydrator and bound object.
    - New form view helpers accept the Form objects in order to generate markup.
    - Object binding allows direct binding of model data to and from the Form.
 - InputFilter (Matthew Weier O'Phinney)
    - New component for object-oriented creation of input filters
    - Input objects compose filter and validator chains, as well as metadata
      such as required, allow empty, break on failure, and more.
    - InputFilter objects compose Input and InputFilter objects, and allow
      validating the entire set or specified validation groups.
 - Log (Enrico Zimuel, Benoit Durand)
    - Refactored to provide more flexibility
    - Adds API discoverability (instead of method overloading)
    - Uses the PluginBroker for loading writers and formatters
    - Uses PriorityQueue to manage writer priority
    - Uses FilterChain for filtering messages
    - Adds a renderer for exceptions, a JSON formatter, and additional interfaces
 - Mail (Enrico Zimuel)
    - Allow batch sending via the SMTP transport
 - ModuleManager (Evan Coury, Matthew Weier O'Phinney)
    - Renamed from "Module" to "ModuleManager"
    - Renamed "Consumer" subnamespace to "Feature"
    - Added new listeners:
      - OnBootstrapListener (Module classes defining onBootstrap() will have
        that method attached as a listener on the Application bootstrap event)
      - LocatorRegistrationListener (Module classes implementing the
        LocatorRegisteredInterface feature will be injected in the
        ServiceManager)
      - ServiceListener (Module classes defining getServiceConfiguration() will
        have that method called, and the configuration merged; once all modules
        are loaded, that merged configuration will be passed to the
        ServiceManager)
 - MVC (Matthew Weier O'Phinney, Ralph Schindler, Evan Coury)
    - Removed Bootstrap class and rewrote Application class
      - Composes a ServiceManager, and simply fires events
    - Added RouteListener and DispatchListener classes, implementing the default
      route and dispatch strategies.
    - Created a new "Service" subnamespace, with ServiceManager configuration
      and factories for the default MVC services.
    - Created a new "ViewManager" class, which triggers on the bootstrap event,
      at which time it creates the various objects of the view layer and wires
      them together as well as registers them with the appropriate events.
    - InjectTemplateListener now uses the controller namespace to further
      namespace the view template; the default is now 
      "<normalized top-level namespace>/<normalized controller name>/<action>"
 - ServiceManager component (Ralph Schindler, Matthew Weier O'Phinney)
    - Highly performant, programmatic service creation
    - Largely replaces DI, but can also consume Zend\Di
    - Allows:
      - Service registration
      - Lazy-loaded service objects
      - Service factories
      - Service aliasing
      - Abstract (fallback) factories
      - Initializers (manipulate instances after creation)
    - Fully integrated in the MVC solution
 - Renamed interfaces (Gabriel Baker, Sascha Prolic, Maks3w)
   - Most, if not all, interfaces were renamed to suffix with the word
     "Interface". This is to promote discovery of interfaces, as well as make
     naming simpler.
   - Exceptions are affected by this as well. Exception marker interfaces were
     renamed to ExceptionInterface and pushed into the Exception subnamespace of
     each component
 - Composer support (Rob Allen, Marco Pivetta, Kyle Spraggs)
   - Zend Framework is now installable via Composer (http://packagist.org/), as
     are each of its individual components
 - Travis CI integration (Marco Pivetta, Maks3w)
   - ZF2 is tested on each commit by http://travis-ci.org/
</pre>

<p>
    In all, well over <strong>400</strong>(!) bug and feature requests were 
    handled since 2.0.0beta2 -- about twice what was handled for beta3, which
    was in turn twice what we handled for beta2! We've definitely hit some
    critical momentum and adoption.
</p>

<p>
    Two changes are particularly noteworthy, as they are not so much code changes
    as infrastructure changes: ZF2 now has <a 
    href="http://packagist.org">Composer</a> support on a per-component basis, and 
    the project now has continuous integration via <a 
    href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a>. A number of contributors helped
    make these initiatives not only possible, but succesful.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="http://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication">skeleton
    application</a> and a <a
    href="http://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonModule">skeleton
    module</a> have been updated for 2.0.0beta4, and are a 
    great place to look to help get you started. You may also want to check out the <a
    href="http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/zend.mvc.quick-start.html">quick start
    guide to the MVC</a>.
</p>

<p>
As a reminder, all ZF2 components are also available individually as <a href="http://pear2.php.net">Pyrus</a> 
 AND composer packages; packages.zendframework.com is our official channel.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to thank each and every person who has contributed ideas, feedback, 
pull requests (no pull request is too small!), testing, and more -- I'm constantly
amazed at the amount of energy and support the community contributes to the framework!

<p>
This is the third in a series of planned beta releases. The beta release
cycle is following the "gmail" style of betas, whereby new features will
be added in each new release, and BC will not be guaranteed; beta
releases will happen <em>approximately</em> every six weeks. The desire is for
developers to adopt and work with new components as they are shipped, and
provide feedback so we can polish the distribution.
</p>

<p>
Once all code in the proposed <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43745438">standard distribution</a> 
has reached maturity and reasonable stability, we will freeze the API and
prepare for Release Candidate status. 
</p>


<p>
Featured components and functionality of 2.0.0beta3 include:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li><b>Refactored Config component</b>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>All configuration readers have been moved under the <code>Zend\Config\Reader</code> namespace</li>
        <li>A <code>Zend\Config\Factory</code> has been added to simplify retrieving a config object from a config file</li>
        <li>Supported configuration formats now support importing additional configuration files</li>
        <li>All constant processing has been moved to a <code>Zend\Config\Processor</code> namespace, and expanded to be more powerful</li>
        <li>Work was provided by Ben Scholzen, Artur Bodera, Enrico Zimuel, and Evan Coury</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>New View layer</b>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>New subcomponents include <code>Zend\View\Model</code>, <code>Zend\View\Resolver</code>, <code>Zend\View\Renderer</code>, and <code>Zend\View\Strategy</code></li>
        <li>The old <code>Zend_View</code> class has been moved to <code>Zend\View\Renderer\PhpRenderer</code>, and rewritten to move most of its responsibilities into collaborators, greatly simplifying its design while simultaneously giving it more capabilities.</li>
        <li>A new class, <code>Zend\View\View</code>, allows selecting rendering strategies on a per-template basis, based on arbitrary criteria, and optionally injecting rendering results into a Response object</code>
        <li>MVC integration streamlines common use cases, including View Model creation and injection, 404 and error page creation, and more.</li>
        <li>Work was provided by Matthew Weier O'Phinney, with copious feedback from Rob Allen.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Rewritten DB layer</b>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>New architecture features low-level drivers, which also provide access to
    the PHP resource being consumed; adapters, which provide basic abstraction
    for common CRUD operations; new SQL abstraction layer, with full predicate
    support; abstraction for ResultSet's, with the ability to cast rows to
    specific object types; abstraction for SQL metadata; and a revised Table and
    Row Data Gateway.</li>
        <li>Work was provided by Ralph Schindler</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>New AgileZen component</b>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li>Support for the full <a href="http://www.agilezen.com">AgileZen</a> API</li>
      <li>Developed for use with <a href="http://framework.zend.com/zf2/board">our planning board</a> </li>
      <li>Work was provided by Enrico Zimuel</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>PHP 5.4 Support</b>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li>A number of issues when running ZF2 under PHP 5.4 were identified and corrected.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    A number of other components received a fair amount of attention during 
    this beta cycle, including Zend\GData, Zend\Navigation, Zend\Session, 
    Zend\Service\StrikeIron, Zend\Service\Technorati, Zend\Service\Twitter, 
    Zend\Http\Header\Accept*, Zend\Ldap, Zend\OAuth. A fair amount of feedback 
    on the MVC and Module components was also provided and acted upon.
</p>

</p>


<p>
Featured components and functionality of 2.0.0beta2 include:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li><b>Refactored Mail component</b>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>The Storage API has been left intact, though several classes and interfaces were shuffled around.</li>
        <li>Zend\Mail\Mail was renamed to Zend\Mail\Message; it now 
            encapsulates a mail message and all headers.  MIME messages are 
            created by attaching a Zend\Mime\Message object as the mail message 
            body</li>
        <li>Added Zend\Mail\Address and Zend\Mail\AddressList, used to 
            represent single addresses and address collections, particularly 
            within mail headers
            </li>
        <li>Added Zend\Mail\Header\* and Zend\Mail\Headers, representations of 
            mail headers.</li>
        <li>A new Zend\Mail\Transport interface defines simply 
            <code>send(Message $message)</code>.  The SMTP, File, and Sendmail 
            transports were rewritten to consume Message objects, and to introduce 
            Options classes.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Refactored Cache component</b>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>Completely rewritten component.</li>
        <li>New API features storage adapters and adapter plugins for 
            implementing cache storage and features such as serialization, 
            clearing, and optimizing.</li>
        <li>Current adapters include filesystem, APC, memcached, and memory.</li>
        <li>All adapters can describe capabilities.</li>
        <li>Plugins are implemented as event listeners.</li>
        <li>A new "Pattern" API was created to simplify things like method, 
            class, object, and output caching.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>MVC updates</b>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>Zend\Module\Manager was stripped of most functionality; it now 
            simply iterates requested modules and triggers events.</li>
        <li>Former manager functionality such as class loading and 
            instantiation, <code>init()</code> triggering, configuration gathering, 
            and autoloader seeding were moved to event listeners.</li>
        <li>Post-module loading configuration globbing support was added, 
            simplifying the story of overriding module configuration.</li>
        <li>The recommended filesystem no longer uses plurals for directory 
            names.</li>
        <li>The recommendations now include a <code>chdir(__DIR__ . 
            '/../')</code> from the "public/index.php" file, and specifying 
            configuration paths to be relative to application directory.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    In addition, over 100 bug and feature requests were handled since 2.0.0beta1.

      <title>2011-11-21 Dev status update</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="toc_3.1">Repository Changes!</h2>

<p>
We've now moved our canonical repository to GitHub, which is where most folks
were forking and doing development anyways. The reasons were several:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
The main reason for self-hosting was to make checking CLA status simpler. As
   ZF2 development no longer requires a CLA, this reason is gone.
</li>
<li>
ACLs for providing commit access are easier to manage on GitHub, and do not
   require us to first receive SSH keys from contributors.
</li>
<li>
Using GitHub directly simplifies the pull request process. When
   self-hosting, we would merge and push to the canonical repo, and then need to
   manually close the pull request; using GitHub, PRs are automatically closed
   when the code is merged. Additionally, because the mirroring only occurred a
   few times per day, it was not immediately evident on GitHub when a change
   was available to test.
</li>
<li>
There was often confusion by developers on where the most current changes
   were, particularly if they forked from the GitHub repository.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The practical upshot is that if you had git.zendframework.com as a remote on
your repository, you should remove it. If you didn't have a
github.com/zendframework/zf2 remote, you should add one. The
<a href="http://bit.ly/zf2gitguide">ZF2 Git Guide</a> details adding the remote.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_3.2">MVC Developments</h2>

<p>
Two big things occurred in the MVC this week.
</p>

<p>
First, we did some re-thinking of the duties of the Module Manager. Previously,
it was responsible for merging configuration and firing module initialization.
A recommended part of module initialization was to initialize autoloading.
</p>

<p>
What we noticed was:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
Configuration merging was getting more complex, and we were getting
   potentially incompatible feature requests.
</li>
<li>
Our modules were getting hard dependencies on things like autoloaders, and
   were also introducing a lot of boiler-plate code.
</li>
<li>
We had no clear path to how we might cache autoloading configuration for
   production.
</li>
<li>
We were noticing more and more places where we might want to loop through the
   loaded modules in order to trigger methods of interest.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, the solution was to change things: <code>Zend\Module\Manager::loadModule()</code> now
triggers a "loadModule" event, passing it the newly created module. This allows
listeners to react to modules real-time as they're loaded. 
</p>

<p>
This also meant that the code for the following actions could be moved to
listeners:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>Autoloading</li>
<li>Configuration loading</li>
<li>Module "initialization"</li>
</ul>

<p>
This allows modules that look like this:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
namespace Blog;

use InvalidArgumentException,
    Zend\EventManager\StaticEventManager,
    Zend\Module\Consumer\AutoloaderProvider;

class Module implements AutoloaderProvider
{
    public function init()
    {
        $events = StaticEventManager::getInstance();
        $events->attach('bootstrap', 'bootstrap', array($this, 'bootstrap'));
    }

    public function getAutoloaderConfig()
    {
        return array(
            'Zend\Loader\ClassMapAutoloader' => array(
                __DIR__ . '/autoload_classmap.php'
            ),
        );
    }

    public function getConfig()
    {
        return include __DIR__ . '/configs/module.config.php';
    }
    
    /* ... */
}
</pre>

<p>
This looks about the same as before! The differences are:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li><code>getAutoloaderConfig()</code> can simply return an array of options to pass to
   <code>Zend\Loader\AutoloaderFactory</code>. This allows us to obtain a fully configured
   autoloader at the end -- which we will eventually be able to cache, and thus
   eliminate the need for the autoloader listener.
</li>
<li><code>getConfig()</code> is no longer called directly by the module manager, but instead
   by a listener. Again, this will make it possible to cache the full
   application configuration.
</li>
<li><code>init()</code> is called by a listener now. </li>
</ul>

<p>
In other words, the differences are largely under the hood. But those
differences mean that it's trivially easy to develop your own listeners to tie
into the module loading process in order to do interesting things -- all without
needing to touch or extend the main module manager.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_3.3">Application Configuration</h2>

<p>
Several people indicated that much as they like module configuration merging,
they weren't liking the solutions for overriding configuration at the
application level. The solutions to date have been:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>Register the module with overrides last -- for instance, your Application module.</li>
<li>Create a configuration-only module that registers last.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The consensus was that a module for simply providing configuration overrides
"sucks", and that using the "Application" module sometimes was problematic
(especially for purposes of registering view script paths).
</p>

<p>
The solution was to add some logic to provide application-level configuration.
This was added to the configuration listener, and allows for you to specify a
directory with configuration (ala "conf.d" style configuration now commonly used
across a number of *nix distributions); this configuration is then merged after
module configuration is aggregated. Your <code>index.php</code> would then contain
something like the following:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
$moduleManager = new Zend\Module\Manager($appConfig['modules']);
$listenerOptions = new Zend\Module\Listener\ListenerOptions($appConfig['module_listener_options']);
$moduleManager->setDefaultListenerOptions($listenerOptions);
$moduleManager->getConfigListener()->addConfigGlobPath(dirname(__DIR__) . '/config/autoload/*.config.php');
$moduleManager->loadModules();
</pre>

<p>
Hopefully, these changes will simplify how app-specific configuration is
managed.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_3.4">Beta2 is coming!</h2>

<p>
Beta2 is coming up soon! We're hoping to have it ready by the end of the month.
The components currently under development for beta2 include:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li>Zend\Log</li>
    <li>Zend\Cache</li>
    <li>Zend\Mail</li>
</ul>

<p>
Cache is mostly complete and needs some review and input regarding its usage of
the EventManager. Log and Mail are currently under development. We encourage
you to reach out on the #zftalk.2 IRC channel on Freenode or the zf-contributors
mailing list if you would like to assist with testing or development of these
components.
</p>

      <title>2011-11-11 Dev status update</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
We've been busy since the last update!
</p>

<p>
The last update was during the busy-ness of <a href="http://zendcon.com/">ZendCon</a>, where we <a href="http://framework.zend.com/zf2/blog/entry/Zend-Framework-2-0-0beta1-Released">announced the first beta release</a> of ZF2. The release was met with a lot of enthusiasm, and we've seen increased usage and testing of ZF2 in the weeks following.
</p>

<p>
Since then, let's recap what's been going on in ZF2 development.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_4.1">IRC Meetings</h2>

<h3 id="toc_4.1.1">26 October 2011 IRC Meeting</h3>

<p>
We held an IRC meeting the Wednesday immediately following ZendCon. During the
meeting, we discussed three items: a nascent ACL/RBAC RFC, differences between
RFCs and proposals, and module distribution and installation.
</p>

<p>
The conclusions were:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
Not enough details as to whether we need to refactor ACL, other than to take
   advantage of some SPL interfaces and classes. Somebody needs to spearhead
   this. Additionally, if those changes are made, the few calls for an RBAC
   component may be moot.
</li>
<li>
RFCs are for architectural changes or to discuss refactors/rewrites of
   <em>existing</em> components; proposals are for <em>new</em> components. Consensus is that
   we need more action and visibility from the CR-Team, and those on the team
   that were present took notes and followed up with a meeting.
</li>
<li>
Basically, the Modules distribution/instalation RFC is on hold until some
   other intitiatives (such as the CLI RFC) are finalized.
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3 id="toc_4.1.2">9 November 2011 IRC Meeting</h3>

<p>
Two weeks later (this week!) we had another IRC meeting, covering three separate
RFCs: Mail, Log, and CLI.
</p>

<p>
Both the Mail and Log RFCs were approved for development, with some
questions/changes/additions/etc. highlighted during the meeting.
</p>

<p>
The CLI RFC is still somewhat rough and needs additional detail, but is headed
in the right direction. 
</p>

</p>

<h2 id="toc_4.2">RFCs</h2>

<p>
Three new RFCs were added (and discussed):
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
<a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/RFC+-+Log+refactoring">Zend\Log refactoring</a>

</ul>

<p>
As noted in the section on IRC meetings, the Log and Mail RFCs have been
approved for development, and are on target for our second beta release. The CLI
RFC is still being revised, but is on target for a potential beta3 release.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_4.3">Development</h2>

<p>
Most development has centered on revisions due to feedback on beta1. In
particular, some new ideas have been fleshed out to simplify the module manager,
while simultaneously making it more flexible and easier to accomplish
initialization tasks (such as retrieving autoloading and configuration
artifacts, registering events, etc). You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/1348598">view a sample here</a>. Additionally, Ralph has been working to accommodate a
number of additional DI use cases identified by users testing the new MVC.
</p>

<p>
Matthew has removed all ZF1 MVC components and pushed them into a new module,
under "modules/ZendFramework1Mvc". As part of that work, he also identified all
components that had dependencies on the old MVC system (particularly the front
controller), and refactored them to remove those dependencies and support
dependency injection. This work is on the current master.
</p>

<p>
Enrico has been working on adapting the latest version of the Windows Azure SDK
to ZF2, as well as addressing it in the Zend\Cloud\Infrastructure component. We
should see this work hitting master early next week.
</p>

<p>
With the Mail and Log RFCs now ratified, development on these will progress, and
we should see fresh code for these components next week.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we announced that ZF2 contributions no longer require a CLA, effective 
immediately. Since the announcement, we've seen quite a number of new pull 
requests from new contributors, and we expect this trend to continue.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_4.4">Fin</h2>

<p>
These are exciting times for Zend Framework 2 development, and we encourage you
to get involved!

We've been busy since the last update!
</p>

<p>
The last update was during the busy-ness of <a href="http://zendcon.com/">ZendCon</a>, where we <a href="http://framework.zend.com/zf2/blog/entry/Zend-Framework-2-0-0beta1-Released">announced the first beta release</a> of ZF2. The release was met with a lot of enthusiasm, and we've seen increased usage and testing of ZF2 in the weeks following.
</p>

<p>
Since then, let's recap what's been going on in ZF2 development.

      <title>Zend Framework 2.0.0beta1 Released!</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
of Zend Framework 2.0.0beta1. Packages and installation instructions are
available at:
</p>

<dl>
    <dd>
    <a href="http://packages.zendframework.com/">http://packages.zendframework.com/</a>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
This is the first in a series of planned beta releases. The beta release
cycle will follow the "gmail" style of betas, whereby new features will
be added in each new release, and BC will not be guaranteed; beta
releases will happen <em>no less than</em> every six weeks. The desire is for
developers to adopt and work with new components as they are shipped, and
provide feedback so we can polish the distribution.
</p>

<p>
Once all code in the proposed <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43745438">standard distribution</a> 
has reached maturity and reasonable stability, we will freeze the API and
prepare for Release Candidate status. 
</p>


<p>
Featured components and functionality of 2.0.0beta1 include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
New and refactored autoloaders:
<ul>
<li>
Zend\Loader\StandardAutoloader
</li>
<li>
Zend\Loader\ClassMapAutoloader
</li>
<li>
Zend\Loader\AutoloaderFactory
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
New plugin broker strategy
<ul>
<li>
Zend\Loader\Broker and Zend\Loader\PluginBroker
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Reworked Exception system
<ul>
<li>
Allow catching by specific Exception type
</li>
<li>
Allow catching by component Exception type
</li>
<li>
Allow catching by SPL Exception type
</li>
<li>
Allow catching by base Exception type
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Rewritten Session component
</li>
<li>
Refactored View component
<ul>
<li>
Split helpers into a PluginBroker
</li>
<li>
Split variables into a Variables container
</li>
<li>
Split script paths into a TemplateResolver
</li>
<li>
Renamed base View class "PhpRenderer"
</li>
<li>
Refactored helpers to utilize __invoke() when possible
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Refactored HTTP component
</li>
<li>
New Zend\Cloud\Infrastructure component
</li>
<li>
New EventManager component
</li>
<li>
New Dependency Injection (Zend\Di) component
</li>
<li>
New Code component
<ul>
<li>
Incorporates refactored versions of former Reflection and
     CodeGenerator components.
</li>
<li>
Introduces Scanner component.
</li>
<li>
Introduces annotation system.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The above components provide a solid foundation for Zend Framework 2, and
largely make up the framework "core". However, the cornerstone feature of beta1
is what they enable: the new MVC layer:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Zend\Module, for developing modular application architectures.
</li>
<li>
Zend\Mvc, a completely reworked MVC layer built on top of HTTP,
   EventManager, and Di.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We've built a <a
    href="http://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication">skeleton
    application</a> and a <a
    href="http://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonModule">skeleton
    module</a> to help get you started, as well as a <a
    href="http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/zend.mvc.quick-start.html">quick start
    guide to the MVC</a>; the new MVC is truly flexible, and moreover, simple and
powerful. 
</p>

<p>
Additionally, for those who haven't clicked on the packages link above, we are
debuting our new distribution mechanisms for ZF2: the ability to use
<a href="http://pear2.php.net">Pyrus</a> to install individual components and/or groups of
components.
</p>

<p>
Since mid-August, we've gone from a <em>few dozen</em> pull requests on the
<a href="http://github.com/zendframework/zf2">ZF2 git repository</a> to <strong><em>over 500</em></strong>,
originating from both long-time Zend Framework contributors as well as those
brand-new to the project. I'd like to thank each and every one of them, but also
call out several individuals who have made some outstanding and important
contributions during that time frame:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://evan.pro">Evan Coury</a>, who prototyped and then implemented the new
   module system.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://akrabat.com">Rob Allen</a>, who, because he was doing a tutorial at
   <a href="http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/">PHPNW</a> on ZF2, provided a lot of early
   feedback, ideas, and advice on the direction of the MVC.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.dasprids.de/">Ben Scholzen</a>, who wrote a new router system, in
   spite of a massive injury from a cycling accident.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://ralphschindler.com">Ralph Schindler</a>, who has had to put up with my
   daily "devil's advocate" and "think of the user!" rants for the past several
   months, and still managed to provide comprehensive code manipulation tools, a
   Dependency Injection framework, and major contributions to the HTTP
   component.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.zimuel.it/en/">Enrico Zimuel</a>, who got tossed requirements for the
   cloud infrastructure component, and then had to rework most of it after
   rewriting the HTTP client from the ground up... and who still managed three
   back-to-back-to-back conferences as we prepared the release.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/abodera">Artur Bodera</a>, who often has played
   devil's advocate, and persisted pressing his opinions on the direction of the
   framework, often despite heavy opposition. We may not implement all (or many)
   of the features you want, but you've definitely influenced the direction of
   the MVC incredibly.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://blog.astrumfutura.com/">Pádraic Brady</a>, who
   <a href="http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/A-Rant-From-Mr-Grumpy-on-ZF2-tp3721463p3721463.html">started the runaway train rolling with a rant</a>, 
   and helped make the project much more transparent, enabling the MVC
   development to occur in the first place.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Welcome to the ZF2 beta cycle!

      <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="toc_3.1">2011-09-28 IRC Meeting</h2>

<p>
We held our fourth IRC meeting on Wednesday, 28 September 2011. On the agenda
were:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
Discussion of a Doctrine Bridge
</li>
<li>
Discussion of the Standard Distribution
</li>
<li>
Roadmap
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The meeting
<a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/2011-09-28+Meeting+Log">has been summarized previously</a>.
The <strong>tl;dr</strong> for those who don't want to click through on the link:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
Everyone agrees we'd like a Doctrine Bridge; it's up to somebody to get
   something concrete rolling.
</li>
<li>
The Standard Distribution was previously defined; however, additions will be
   considered on a case-by-case basis.
</li>
<li>
Expect beta 1 to drop during ZendCon.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_3.2">Development Notes</h2>

<h3 id="toc_3.2.1">View Convenience API</h3>

<p>
After a <a href="http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/ZF2-Status-Update-tp3845571p3845571.html">prolonged discussion</a>, 
I worked on a "View Convenience API". The goal was to simplify view usage and
syntax.
</p>

<p>
The end result is a syntax very much like ZF1, but more performant under the
hood, and with easier ways to get at the various helper objects. Per a
suggestion (and pull request!) from <a href="http://akrabat.com/">Rob Allen</a>, we
now extract view variables prior to rendering the view script. Since the
Variables container returns escaped versions of variables by default, this makes
for very succinct syntax. You may also access variables using property
overloading (e.g., <code>$this-&gt;foo</code>), via a <code>get()</code> method, or by accessing the
Variables container directly. Additionally, you can now access the unescaped
values using a new <code>raw()</code> method in the renderer.
</p>

<p>
Helpers can now be accessed via method overloading, as they were in ZF1. The
following will occur:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
If the helper is invocable (i.e., a functor, implementing the <code>__invoke()</code>
   magic method), it will be invoked with any arguments passed.
</li>
<li>
If not invocable, the helper instance will be returned.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally, an "escape" view helper was created. This is composed into the
Variables container by default, and allows specifying alternate callbacks and
encoding when desired.
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
&lt;?php $this->gt;headTitle($title) ?>
&lt;h2>gt;&lt;?= $title ?>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>gt;
&lt;?php foreach ($entries as $entry): ?>gt;
    &lt;li>gt;&lt;?= $this->escape($entry->getName()) ?>&lt;/li>
&lt;?php endforeach ?>gt;
&lt;/ul>gt;
</pre>

<p>
<strong>tl;dr:</strong> The view layer is fun again!
</p>

<h3 id="toc_3.2.2">Controller Convenience API</h3>

<p>
Following a couple
<a href="http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/ActionController-convenience-API-tp3848772p3848772.html">short</a> <a href="http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/Controller-convenience-API-redux-tp3873283p3873283.html">threads</a> about a controller convenience API, I
implemented a few new features in the MVC controller layer:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
Controllers may be optionally "event injectible". If they are, they will be
   injected with the <code>MvcEvent</code> used in the <code>Application</code> object. This allows it
   to be tied more closely into the full request cycle.
</li>
<li>
Controllers may be optionally "locator aware". If they implement the
   <code>LocatorAware</code> interface, they will be injected with the DI container or
   Service Locator attached to the Application. This can be used to pull out
   optional dependencies.
</li>
<li>
We've created a controller-layer plugin broker, analagous to ZF1's "action
   helper" system. The idea behind this is to provide re-usable functionality
   for controllers in a light-weight fashion. Unlike ZF1, these plugins will not
   be workflow-aware, and will only optionally be injected with the current
   controller (based on presence of a <code>setController()</code> method).
</li>
<li>
You can access controller plugins via method overloading. Unlike view
   helpers, method overloading only ever returns the plugin instance.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, in a nutshell:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
class FooController extends ActionController
{
    public function processAction()
    {
        // Locator-awareness for pulling conditional functionality:
        $form = $this-&gt;getLocator()-&gt;get('foo-form');
        
        $post = $this-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;post()-&gt;toArray();
        if ($form-&gt;isValid($post)) {
            // do some processing
            // Redirection via a plugin:
            return $this-&gt;redirect()-&gt;toRoute('foo-success');
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
Working controller plugins now include:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
<strong>Url</strong> (generates URLs from a configured router)
</li>
<li>
<strong>Redirect</strong> (updates the Response object with a redirect status code an Location
   header; Location URL can be either a static URL or generated from the router)
</li>
<li>
<strong>FlashMessenger</strong> (session-based flash messages)
</li>
<li>
<strong>Forward</strong> (dispatch an additional controller)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The last plugin enables users to dispatch an additional controller -- without
requiring a dispatch loop within the <code>Application::run()</code> logic! It <em>does</em>,
however, require that the controller calling it be defined as <code>LocatorAware</code>, so
that it can obtain the configured controller instance.
</p>

<p>
<strong>tl;dr:</strong> The Controller layer is getting a lot of good functionality.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_3.2.3">Zend\Code refactoring</h3>

<p>
Ralph worked for several weeks on a refactoring of the <code>Zend\Code</code> component.
Part of this was moving <code>Reflection</code> and <code>CodeGenerator</code> under that tree, as
well as ensuring the APIs were consistent across all three components (as
<code>Zend\Code</code> also contains the <code>Scanner</code> component). This work was merged on 6
October 2011. 
</p>

<p>
Part of this update also included a comprehensive annotations parser. This
allows us to now scan docblocks for annotations and represent them as objects,
giving rise to a number of potential new workflows for ZF2.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_3.2.4">DI Updates</h3>

<p>
One key driver behind annotations support was to allow using annotations to hint
to the DI Compiler how to create definitions. Additionally, work was done to
allow creating definitions via configuration. This allows things like:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
use Zend\Di\Definition\Annotation as Di;

class Foo
{
    /**
     * @Di\Inject()
     */
    public function setEvents(EventCollection $events)
    {
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
which will inform the DI container that this method should be injected at
construction. Additionally, you can now do things like this:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
$config['di'] = array(
'definition' => array('class' => array(
    'Mongo' => array(
        '__construct' => array(
            'server'  => array(
                'required' => false,
                'type'     => false,
            ),
            'options' => array('required' => false),
        ),
    ),
    'MongoDB' => array(
        '__construct' => array(
            'conn' => array(
                'required' => true,
                'type'     => 'Mongo',
            ),
            'name' => array(
                'required' => true, 
                'type'     => false,
            ),
        ),
    ),
    'MongoCollection' => array(
        '__construct' => array(
            'db' => array(
                'required' => true,
                'type'     => 'MongoDB',
            ),
            'name' => array(
                'required' => true, 
                'type'     => false,
            ),
        ),
    ),
    'Blog\EntryResource' => array(
        'setCollectionClass' => array(
            'class' => array(
                'required' => false,
                'type'     => false,
            ),
        ),
    ),
)),
'instance' => array(
    'Mongo' => array('parameters' => array(
        'server'  => 'mongodb://localhost:27017',
    )),
 
    'MongoDB' => array( 'parameters' => array(
        'conn' => 'Mongo',
        'name' => 'myblogdb',
    )),
 
    'MongoCollection' => array('parameters' => array(
        'db'   => 'MongoDB',
        'name' => 'entries',
    )),
 
    'Blog\EntryResource' => array('parameters' => array(
        'dataSource' => 'CommonResource\DataSource\Mongo',
        'class'      => 'CommonResource\Resource\MongoCollection',
    )),
 
    'CommonResource\DataSource\Mongo' => array('parameters' => array(
        'connection' => 'MongoCollection',
    )),
));
</pre>

<p>
The above will ensure that we use the provided scalar values for injection in
the various constructors and setters in the definition, and still allows for
object injection when required (e.g., conn, db, dataSource, connection).
</p>

<p>
<strong>tl;dr:</strong> DI has become incredibly flexible and powerful!
</p>

<h3 id="toc_3.2.5">Cloud Infrastructure</h3>

<p>
Enrico managed to finish testing all <code>Zend\Cloud\Infrastructure</code> functionality,
with <em>both</em> online <em>and</em> offline tests! This gives us great confidence in the
components (plural, as all infrastructure services also have related components
under <code>Zend\Service</code>), and makes for a great new feature in ZF2. Enrico also
backported the Infrastructure component to ZF1's trunk, in anticipation of an
additional release on the ZF1 tree in the future.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_3.2.6">CLI Module</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://robertbasic.com/">Robert Basic</a> <a href="http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/A-ZF2-Cli-module-tp3865659p3865659.html"> wrote to the list about a prototype CLI
module</a>. The basic idea is to leverage the module architecture for executing CLI
requests; routing would be performed utilizing <code>Zend\Console\Getopt</code> instead of
the MVC router. Additionally, it would provide functionality for colorizing
output. Overall, a solid beginning to a potential new console component!
</p>

<h3 id="toc_3.2.7">Presentations</h3>

<p>
Both <a href="http://akrabat.com">Rob Allen</a> and <a href="http://robertbasic.com">Robert Basic</a>
gave presentations during the weekend of 7 - 9 October 2011, with Robert Basic
giving a general overview session on ZF2 at <a href="http://webkonf.org/">Webkonf</a> and
Rob Allen giving a full day tutorial at <a href="http://phpnw.org.uk">PHPNW</a>. Rob Allen's
slides may be viewed
<a href="http://akrabat.com/wp-content/uploads/PHPNW11-ZF2-Tutorial.pdf">online</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_3.3">The Future</h2>

<p>
We have an
<a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/2011-10-12+Meeting+Agenda">IRC
meeting this coming Wednesday, 12 Oct 2011</a>; please post topics and/or vote on
those already posted -- and make sure you're in attendance for the discussions!
</p>

<p>
Also, we'll be tagging <strong>beta1</strong> this week, in preparation for a release during
ZendCon next week. If you have feedback on the MVC or DI, please let us know
ASAP!

      <title>2011-09-26 Dev status update</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="toc_4.1">2011-09-14 IRC Meeting</h2>

<p>
We held our third IRC meeting on Wednesday, 14 September 2011. On the agenda
were:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
<a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/Comparison+of+config+styles">RFC on configuration</a>
</li>
<li>
Where components falling outside the standard distribution should live if
   incomplete
</li>
<li>
Goals of the Module Manager
</li>
<li>
Directory structure for modules
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_4.1.1">Configuration</h3>

<p>
Between the competing RFCs on configuration, the IRC discussion, and some
back-and-forth following the meeting, the following summarizes the current
consensus on how ZF2 will deal with component configuration:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
Hard dependencies that do not have sane defaults would be in the constructor
   signature
</li>
<li>
The last argument in the constructor signature would be optional, and expect
   an instance of the component's Options class
</li>
<li>
If a dependency has a sane default, we would not include an argument in the
   constructor, but <em>would</em> allow setter injection (which could be automated by
   the DI container)
</li>
<li>
The component's Options class would handle optional configuration arguments,
   and provide validation for those arguments.
</li>
<li>
The component would directly access optional arguments from the Options
   instance it composes
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note the word "Options". In discussions, we decided we should call this
functionality "Options" as it denotes that the values are optional, and also to
prevent nomenclature conflicts with the already existing <code>Zend\Config</code>
component. We will be producing a poll on the wiki to do a final vote <em>very soon</em>. 
</p>

<h3 id="toc_4.1.2">Unfinished "Extras" components</h3>

<p>
The discussion centered around whether or not we would remove unrefactored
components that fall outside the standard distribution -- things like service
components that have not been converted to namespaces, updated to latest
exceptions practices, and not refactored to use the new HTTP functionality.
</p>

<p>
Only slight debate erupted -- the decision is:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
Keep this functionality in the master branch
</li>
<li>
Add an annotation such as "@incomplete" to the file and/or class-level
   docblocks.
</li>
<li>
Add the "@incomplete" annotation to related test classes, and add a rule to
   <code>phpunit.xml</code> to skip such tests.
</li>
<li>
Comment out sections in the manual referring to these components.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We will then add rules to packaging to omit such classes and resources.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_4.1.3">Module Manager Goals</h3>

<p>
The Module Manager is a component for scanning and initializing modules during
application bootstrapping. As such, it's fairly central to the new MVC approach,
and we wanted to be sure we captured its goals. A sizable list of goals was
presented, and we voted on each. There are too many to relate here, so instead
I'll simply
<a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/2011-09-14+Meeting+Log#2011-09-14MeetingLog-ModuleManagergoals">link you to the summary</a>.
</p>

<p>
Most items were straight-forward, but there are a few conflicting ideas about
what the scope of the manager; should it simply act as a kernel for
bootstrapping, or have deep ties within the application?
</p>

<p>
Current development of this tool has taken the former approach, but has exposed
a number of useful features that allow a ton of flexibility for a variety of
approaches. One, in particular, is a method <code>getLoadedModules()</code>, which returns
an associative array of module name/module objects. With this, I was able to do
such things as loop through modules, check for the existence of specific
methods, and then call them to do things such as event listener registration. 
</p>

<h3 id="toc_4.1.4">Module Directory Structure</h3>

<p>
By the time of the meeting, we already had a couple different module directory
structures floating around, and the discussion centered on which one to use.
Except that several people brought up one very, very good point: with a
well-known class (the module's "Module" class) that we're querying, the
structure doesn't matter, and does not need to be enforced.
</p>

<p>
As such, our decision was that we should have a <em>recommended</em> structure that
satisfies the various use cases we originally brainstormed. Among these:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
Ability to serve multiple namespaces (if desired)
</li>
<li>
Separation of code from non-code assets, if provided (such as CSS, JS, HTML)
</li>
<li>
Separation of view templates, if provided, from code
</li>
<li>
Separation of configuration, if provided, from code
</li>
</ul>

<p>
As such, the following structure was <em>generally</em> agreed upon as a
recommendation:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
modules/
    SpinDoctor/
        Module.php
        autoload_classmap.php
        autoload_function.php
        autoload_register.php
        configs/
            module.config.php
            routes.config.ini
        public/
            images/
            css/
                spin-doctor.css
            js/
                spin-doctor.js
        src/
            SpinDoctor/
                Controller/
                    SpinDoctorController.php
                    DiscJockeyController.php
                Form/
                    Request.php
        tests/
            bootstrap.php
            phpunit.xml
            SpinDoctor/
                Controller/
                    SpinDoctorControllerTest.php
                    DiscJockeyControllerTest.php
        views/
            spin-doctor/
                album.phtml
            disc-jockey/
                turntable.phtml
</pre>

<p>
Public assets such as images, CSS, and JS could either be symlinked into the
public tree, copied, or managed by an asset manager such as
<a href="https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic">Assetic</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Regarding the various <code>autoload_*.php</code> files, these were brought up in a
<a href="http://ralphschindler.com/2011/09/19/autoloading-revisited">post from Ralph</a>,
based on discussions he and I have had. The idea behind these is that we can
satisfy several typical use cases for modules:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
Download and use: simply <code>require 'autoload_register.php';</code> and start using
   classes.
</li>
<li>
Use with custom registration: <code>spl_autoload_register(include 'autoload_function.php');</code>, 
   which allows you to specify to <code>spl_autoload_register</code> whether or not to
   append or prepend the function to your autoloader stack.
</li>
<li>
Custom autoloading class map: aggregate the returns of
   <code>autoload_classmap.php</code> into a single classmap for your application.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There's still some discussion going around these files, but they've been adopted
in the prototypes at this time.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_4.2">MVC Prototype Status</h2>

<p>
The MVC prototype has grown tremendously, in large part due to the efforts of
<a href="http://evan.pro/">Evan Coury</a> and his work on the Module Manager. The module
manager now does the following:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
Aggregates configuration from all modules
    <ul class="ul">
    <li>
    Including modules provided as phars!
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
Provides introspection and access to discovered modules
</li>
<li>
Optionally allows configuration caching
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The MVC prototype has also grown. Based on a suggestion from Greg N. on the
mailing lists, the EventManager was refactored slightly to do the following:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
Removed references to "handlers" in favor of "listeners" to provide a
   consistent terminology (both internally as well as with other systems of
   similar design)
</li>
<li>
<code>trigger</code> now allows passing an <code>Event</code> object for any one of its required
   arguments. This allows creation of custom <code>Event</code> objects, as well as re-use
   of them.
</li>
<li>
<code>trigger</code> was modified to allow an optional final argument, either the fourth
   argument or an argument following an <code>Event</code> object: a callback that
   indicates whether or not to halt execution. This largely eliminates the need
   for <code>triggerUntil</code> at this time.
</li>
<li>
Locally attached listeners are now combined with static listeners into a
   single priority queue when <code>trigger</code> is called. This provides a consistent
   expectation, and allows you to register static listeners that can be called
   prior to those attached locally.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
What the above allowed was the ability to move routing and dispatching into
listeners within <code>Zend\Mvc\Application</code>, using a custom <code>MvcEvent</code> object. The
upshot is:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li>
Simpler code
</li>
<li>
Accessors for well-known (and/or expected) objects (e.g., <code>getRequest()</code>,
   <code>getRouteMatch()</code>, <code>getResult()</code>)
</li>
<li>
Events are registered with priority in order to shape the execution workflow
</li>
<li>
The ability to replace the default routing and dispatch listeners with custom
   listeners.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This last point allowed me to prototype a 
<a href="https://github.com/weierophinney/zf-quickstart/tree/features/zf2_mvc-zf1_emulation">ZF1-emulation layer in the new ZF2 paradigm</a>.
This effort was surprisingly easy, and helped illustrate how flexible the
prototype can be.
</p>

<p>
Additional work on the MVC centered around error handling, and providing a
simple mechanism for discovering and handling errors. The 
<a href="https://github.com/weierophinney/zf-quickstart/tree/features/zf2-mvc-module">zf-quickstart example</a>
showed that this largely eliminates the need for an <code>ErrorController</code>.
</p>

<p>
At this time, we're quickly closing in on what the MVC will likely look like for
ZF2, and hope to merge the <code>ZendMvc</code> and <code>ZendModule</code> modules into the library
very soon.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_4.3">DI Annotation Support</h2>

<p>
Ralph has been refactoring the <code>Reflection</code>, <code>CodeGenerator</code>, and <code>Code\Scanner</code>
components to follow a consistent API, and to live under a common tree,
<code>Zend\Code</code>. Part of this work is to also provide a parser/tokenizer for PHP
docblocks, with the goal of providing annotation support to components that need
it. In particular, this could assist the Dependency Injection component,
allowing more intelligent hinting as to what setters are required and/or the
specific arguments to inject. Another potential use might be with modules, to
indicate what they provide and/or methods that should be called at
initialization.
</p>

<p>
This work should hit master this week, and will be compatible with the
<a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/docblock">docblock extension</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_4.4">Cloud Infrastructure</h2>

<p>
Enrico has been working on updating the Amazon, Rackspace, and GoGrid services
to use the new HTTP functionality. In doing so, he's discovered areas where the
HTTP component needed improvement, as well as places he could better test. At
this time, all changes he's done are incorporated in the master branch, with the
exception of some tests for GoGrid.
</p>

<p>
This work has helped round out a new offering in Zend Framework, as well as to
test recent development work and ideas such as the HTTP component and the
Options proposal.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_4.5">The Future</h2>

<p>
There are new RFCs and discussions erupting regularly on the mailing list and in
the #zftalk.2 IRC channel on Freenode; I encourage you to subscribe to the former and join in the latter so that you can participate.
</p>

<p>
Also, we have an IRC meeting <em>this week</em>, 28 September 2011 at 17:00 UTC. The
<a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/2011-09-28+Meeting+Agenda">agenda</a>
is online, but could potentially use some more topics and votes. Talk to you
Wednesday!
