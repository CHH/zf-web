Q: What version of PHP do I need to run Zend Framework?
A: PHP 5.1.4 or later is required for using Zend Framework, which is also tested against
   the current version of <a href="http://zend.com/core/">Zend Core</a>. Sorry, PHP 4 will not
   be supported.

Q: What about the database adapters?
A: If your version of PHP 5 lacks the PDO drivers, they can be installed as PECL extensions.
   The PDO extensions can be downloaded from:
   <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/pdo">http://pecl.php.net/package/pdo</a>.
   At this time we are also investigating the possibility of making adapters available for users
   who are unable to install PDO.

Q: Why does my include() to a Zend Framework file fail?
A: Please be sure to read the README.txt file that ships with the Zend
   Framework distribution.  You may need to add the Zend Framework library directory
   to your include_path.

Q: Can I use Zend Framework with __autoload()?
A: Yes, as of release 0.1.2.  Use Zend_Loader::registerAutoload() for this purpose.
