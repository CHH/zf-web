Q: Where can I find the Zend Framework license?
A: <a href="/license">http://framework.zend.com/license</a>


Q: Is there a fee for using Zend Framework in a commercial product?
A: No.


Q: May I call my modified code &quot;Zend Framework&quot;?
A: The license prohibits you from using &quot;Zend Framework&quot; or &quot;Zend&quot;
   in the name of the modified code. In any case, we think that software you create
   should stand on its own merit.


Q: I've made changes to Zend Framework. Do I need to contribute them back?
A: The Zend Framework license, which is a BSD/Apache/PHP-style license, is not viral.
   You may keep changes to yourself and are not required to contribute them back. That
   said, if you believe your changes would be useful to other Zend Framework users, we
   encourage you to share these patches with us. Please remember that in order for your
   contribution to be considered you are required to sign a
   <a href="/framework_cla_1.0.pdf">Contributor License Agreement</a>
   giving us license to use your source code.  For companies contributing team efforts,
   only one CLA is required.  A <a href="/framework_cla_corporate_1.0.pdf">multiple contributor agreement</a> 
   is also available. 


Q: Can I use PEAR code with Zend Framework?
A: The licenses appearing at http://pear.php.net/manual/en/faq.licenses.php seem to all
   be compatible with Zend Framework license. That said we haven't formally verified
   that nor have we checked that all packages in PEAR are under the listed licenses.


Q: I have a question about the Contributor License Agreement. Where can I find more information?
A: See the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Contributor+License+Agreement#ContributorLicenseAgreement-CLAFAQ">CLA FAQ</a>.
