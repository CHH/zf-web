        advisory regarding Dojo Toolkit , which Zend Framework bundles in its
    releases. The new releases of Zend Framework incorporate the updates made to
    Dojo Toolkit.

    Almost a month has passed since our  alpha release of
        1.10.0 , but the activity on the Zend Framework trunk has done
    anything but slow down. A number of contributors have completed features
    that were only near-completion during the alpha, and others have undergone
    further community review to add a bit of polish to their APIs.
 

 
    At this time, I'm happy to announce a  BETA  release of 1.10.0.

    For those of you monitoring the Zend Framework SVN the last few weeks, you
    will likely have noticed a huge surge of activity as contributors have
    scrambled to complete code in time for the 1.10.0 release. The release is
    getting close, and I'm happy to announce an  ALPHA  release of 1.10.0.

                 	 I just this morning pushed a new version of Zend DevZone, and the biggest change was a move to Zend Framework version 1.9.5 &#8211; Why is this important?  Because it was previously running v1.0.1 ( gasp ), and I wanted to tell the story of the work it took to upgrade.
