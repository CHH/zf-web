<h2>ZF2012-01: Local file disclosure via XXE injection in Zend_XmlRpc</h2>

<p>
    <code>Zend_XmlRpc</code> is vulnerable to XML eXternal Entity (XXE)
    Injection attacks. The <code>SimpleXMLElement</code> class (SimpleXML PHP extension) is
    used in an insecure way to parse XML data. External entities can be specified
    by adding a specific DOCTYPE element to XML-RPC requests. By exploiting this
    vulnerability an application may be coerced to open arbitrary files and/or TCP
    connections.
</p>

<h3>Action Taken</h3>

<p>
    The <code>Request</code> and <code>Response</code> implementations in 
    <code>Zend_XmlRpc</code> were patched to ensure 
    <code>libxml_disable_entity_loader()</code> is invoked prior to instantiating
    any <code>SimpleXML</code> objects. This disables XXE parsing, and thus
    disables the attack vector.
</p>

<p>
    This patch has been applied starting in versions 1.11.12 and 1.12.0 of Zend 
    Framework, and has been ported to the upcoming version 2.0.0 development
    branch (and will be included starting with the 2.0.0beta5 release).
</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>
    If you are using either <code>Zend_XmlRpc_Server</code> or 
    <code>Zend_XmlRpc_Client</code> in your projects, we recommend 
    <b>immediately</b> upgrading to 1.11.12 or greater.
