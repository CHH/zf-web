    <p>
        Much of the day-to-day communication and decision-making for Zend 
        Framework happens on Internet Relay Chat (IRC). A number of channels
        are available for those seeking help, as well as those interested
        in assisting in the development of the framework.
    </p>

    <p>
        All channels are on <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode IRC</a>.
